# sr.ht

Private file hosting for you and your friends.

I run a private instance of legacy.sr.ht *at* [drop.jrgnsn.net][0]. You
can request an invite if you know me personally. Otherwise, here are the
setup instructions to run it on your own infrastructure:

[0]:https://drop.jrgnsn.net

## Running the site

Quick overview:

1. Install dependencies
2. Set up dependencies
3. Clone the repository
7. Configure the site
8. Compile static assets
9. Set up SQL
10. Deployment

**Install the dependencies**

You'll need these things:

* Python 3
* PostgreSQL
* scss
* Flask
* SQLAlchemy
* Flask-Login
* psycopg2
* bcrypt

Use the packages your OS provides, or build them from source.

**Set up services**

I'll leave you to set up PostgreSQL however you please. Prepare a
connection string that looks like this when you're done:

    postgresql://username:password@hostname:port/database

The connection string I use on localhost is this:

    postgresql://srht:REDACTED@localhost/legacy.sr.ht

We need to be able to create/alter/insert/update/delete in the database
you give it.

**Clone the repository**

Find a place you want the code to live.

    $ git clone https://git.sr.ht/~mjorgensen/legacy.sr.ht
    $ cd legacy.sr.ht

**Configure the site**

    $ cp alembic.ini.example alembic.ini
    $ cp config.ini.example config.ini

Edit config.ini and alembic.ini to your liking.

**Compile static assets**

    $ make

Run this again whenever you pull the code.

**Deployment**

What you do from here depends on your site-specific configuration. If
you just want to run the site for development, you can source the
virtualenv and run

    python app.py

To run it in production, you probably want to use gunicorn behind an
nginx proxy. There's a sample nginx config in the `contrib/` directory
here, but you'll probably want to tweak it to suit your needs. Here's
how you can run gunicorn, put this in your init scripts:

    /path/to/legacy.sr.ht/bin/gunicorn app:app -b 127.0.0.1:8000

The `-b` parameter specifies an endpoint to use. You probably want to
bind this to localhost and proxy through from nginx. I'd also suggest
blocking the port you choose from external access. It's not that
gunicorn is *bad*, it's just that nginx is better.

When running in a production enviornment, run `python app.py` at least
once and then read the SQL stuff below before you let it go for good.

nginx configuration is available in `contrib/nginx.conf`, modify it to
suit your environment. **nginx is required to run legacy.sr.ht
properly**.

## Becoming an admin

You can become an admin like so:

    $ cd /path/to/sr.ht/
    $ source bin/activate
    $ python
    >>> from srht.database import db
    >>> from srht.objects import User
    >>> from datetime import datetime, timezone
    >>> u = User.query.filter(User.username == "your username").first()
    >>> u.approved = True # approve yourself
    >>> u.approvalDate = datetime.now(timezone.utc)
    >>> u.admin = True # make yourself an admin
    >>> db.commit()

## SQL Stuff

We use alembic for schema migrations between versions. The first time
you run the application, the schema will be created. However, you need
to tell alembic about it. Run the application at least once, then:

    $ cd /path/to/sr.ht/
    $ source bin/activate
    $ python
    >>> from alembic.config import Config
    >>> from alembic import command
    >>> alembic_cfg = Config("alembic.ini")
    >>> command.stamp(alembic_cfg, "head")
    >>> exit()

Congrats, you've got a schema in place. Run `alembic upgrade head` after
pulling the code to update your schema to the latest version. Do this
before you restart the site.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the site with template overrides.
Create a directory called `overrides` and copy templates from the
`templates` directory into `overrides`. Modify them as you see fit, they
will be used instead of the version from `templates`.
